# Local optimization results

Measured on Windows on 2026-08-24, starting from revision `43d3f07`. These are
synthetic regression fixtures, not claims about every consumer workload.

## Screening comparison

The table compares the unmodified starting revision with the optimized working
tree on the same machine. Both used the direct `System` allocator, seven timing
samples, and `CFGLIB_BENCH_MS=1`. That short target is useful for ranking large
regressions while iterating, but the absolute values are intentionally treated
as approximate. Mutation timings include the fixture clone named by each case.

The starting global-value-numbering fixture overflowed the Windows stack on a
2,048-block dominator chain; the iterative implementation completes it. The
starting weighted reducibility transformation also failed its semantic oracle
because copied outgoing edges lost their weights; the optimized version retains
edge kind, weight, identity rules, and adjacency order.

## Verification run

A longer current-tree run with `CFGLIB_BENCH_MS=25` completed all 152 cases and
all semantic oracles. The registry verified benchmark coverage for all 132
root-facade free functions. The allocation-instrumented build also completed
every case and verified that each measured operation returned to its starting
live-byte baseline.

Selected results from that facade run are below. CPU values are medians of
seven samples with a 25 ms minimum per sample. Allocation values are one
steady-state operation after warm-up. Mutation cases include fixture cloning.

The zero-allocation reusable-scratch search is a useful harness sanity check:
the corresponding allocating `search` entry point reports 11 allocations on
the same 1,024-node workload. Use the commands in [README.md](README.md) to
reproduce either mode; pinning an otherwise-idle machine and increasing the
target duration is recommended before making small-factor decisions.
