//! Data flow analysis framework.
//!
//! Provides generic infrastructure for computing data flow properties
//! over a [`Cfg`]:
//!
//! - **Reaching definitions** — which writes can reach a given point
//! - **Liveness** — which variables are live at each point
//! - **Def-use / use-def chains** — linking writers to readers
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Implement [`DataDeps`] for your instruction type to declare which
//! locations each instruction reads from and writes to, then run any
//! of the provided analyses.
