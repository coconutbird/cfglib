/// [`crate::open_search`] answers questions about nodes and can only stop; this

/// lookup is the motivating shape: a class answers with its own declaration
/// if it has one, else with the answer of exactly one yielding base
/// subobject, and two yielding subobjects make the name ambiguous. Under
/// [`VisitedPolicy::Path`] the marks release at
/// [`Finish`](OpenDfsEvent::Finish), so a diamond's shared base is folded
/// once per route through it — and that re-fold is precisely what makes the
/// ambiguity visible. A globally marked walk answers the same question
/// "unambiguous", confidently and wrongly.
///
/// `successors` is handed a node and a scratch buffer, **cleared before every
/// call**, and pushes that node's successors *in the order they should be
/// explored*, exactly as in [`crate::open_search`]. Nodes are compared and marked by
/// `Ord`.
///
/// # Events
///
/// The event order is deterministic and part of the API. The walk is
/// iterative — an explicit frame stack, no recursion — so a deep space costs
/// heap, not stack.
///
/// - **[`Discover`](OpenDfsEvent::Discover)`(node, depth)`** is emitted when
///   the walk enters a node, seeds first at depth 0 in the order given and
///   then successors in the order the closure pushed them.
/// - **[`Finish`](OpenDfsEvent::Finish)`(node)`** is emitted when the node's
///   last successor has finished, strictly last in, first out. Every
///   `Discover` is matched by exactly one `Finish`, the walk breaking being
///   the one exception (below).
/// - **[`Refused`](OpenDfsEvent::Refused)`(node, depth)`** replaces that pair
///   when the mark policy declines the re-entry. The re-entry is *reported*
///   rather than silently dropped, because for a fold it is a real answer:
///   a cycle under [`VisitedPolicy::Path`], a lost contribution under
///   [`VisitedPolicy::Global`].
/// - **[`Visit::Skip`]** prunes: the successor closure is not called for that
///   node — which matters when discovering successors costs a file read —
///   and the node **still finishes**, immediately, as a leaf. Pruning is a
///   statement about the subtree, not about the node, and a fold that had to
///   reduce a pruned node somewhere other than its `Finish` would need two
///   reduction sites for one answer. (This is the C++ rule itself: a class
///   that declares the name hides every base declaration, so its bases are
///   never searched, and its own declaration is the answer it finishes with.)
/// - The verdict returned for a `Finish` or a `Refused` is **ignored**; there
///   is nothing left to prune. Return
///   `ControlFlow::Continue(`[`Visit::Descend`]`)`.
/// - **`max_depth` bounds expansion, not visiting**: a node at the bound is
///   discovered and finished, and its successors are never discovered.
/// - **Seeds**: under [`VisitedPolicy::Global`] a seed already reached from
///   an earlier seed is `Refused` at depth 0; under [`VisitedPolicy::Path`]
///   the stack is empty between seeds, so every mark has been released and a
///   repeated seed is walked again.
/// - **[`ControlFlow::Break`]** returns immediately with `Some(value)`: the
///   frames still on the stack do **not** finish, so a visitor that breaks
///   owns whatever it broke with rather than a completed fold.
///
