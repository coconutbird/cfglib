/// every discovery and every route refused by global marks, and return the
/// value the callback broke with (or `None` when the walk completed).
///
/// `successors` receives a node and a scratch buffer that is **cleared before
/// every call**. It pushes successors in their desired discovery order. Nodes
/// are compared and marked by `Ord`.
///
/// # Semantics
///
/// - Seeds are discovered at depth zero in the order supplied. A duplicate
///   seed produces [`Refused`](OpenBfsEvent::Refused).
/// - Nodes are expanded level by level in discovery order. Successors are
///   discovered in the order the closure pushes them.
/// - [`Visit::Skip`] prevents expansion without removing the node's mark.
/// - `max_depth` bounds expansion, not discovery. A node at the bound still
///   produces [`Discover`](OpenBfsEvent::Discover).
/// - A route to any previously discovered node produces `Refused`, including
///   routes to a node still waiting in the frontier.
/// - [`ControlFlow::Break`] stops immediately and is returned as `Some(value)`.
///
/// # Examples
