/// Follow an out-degree ≤ 1 chase from `seed` and return where it ends.
///
/// `step` reports the next node, or `None` at the end of the chain. The chase
/// stops — returning the **last** node it stood on — when `step` yields
/// `None`, when `max_hops` steps have been taken, or when the next node is
/// already on the path walked so far.
///
/// The cycle guard is the **full path**, not just the seed: an alias chain
/// that re-enters itself three hops in is a cycle even though it never
/// returns to where it started. `max_hops` keeps that scan small (and is the
/// real bound for a chase over an untrusted graph).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use cfglib::follow;
///
/// // A chain of type aliases: 0 -> 1 -> 2, and 2 is the real definition.
/// let chain = |node: &u32| match node {
///     0 => Some(1),
///     1 => Some(2),
///     _ => None,
/// };
/// assert_eq!(follow(0, 16, chain), 2);
///
/// // A cycle stops at the last node before it closes.
/// let cyclic = |node: &u32| Some((node + 1) % 3);
/// assert_eq!(follow(0, 16, cyclic), 2);

/// // So does the hop bound.
