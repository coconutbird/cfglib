//! Breadth-first simple-route enumeration over an open node space.
//!
//! This is the breadth-first form of once-per-route walking. The depth-first
//! form is [`open_depth_first_events`](super::open_depth_first_events) under
//! [`VisitedPolicy::Path`](crate::VisitedPolicy::Path), which a stack gets
//! almost for free: one path is active at a time, and its marks release on
//! the unwind. A breadth-first frontier holds many partial routes at once and
//! never unwinds, so here every frontier entry owns its route outright — the
//! same semantics, bought with the state a frontier actually has.

/// distinct route. The first [`Route`](OpenPathsEvent::Route) satisfying a
/// consumer predicate is therefore a *shortest* satisfying route — the
/// guarantee the depth-first form cannot make.
///
/// `successors` receives a node and a scratch buffer that is **cleared before
/// every call**. It pushes successors in their desired discovery order. Nodes
/// are compared by `PartialEq` along one route only, so no ordering is
/// required.
///
/// # Cost
///
/// Simple-route enumeration is exponential in the worst case — a route tree,
/// not a node set. Memory is proportional to the live frontier's total route
/// length and there are no `O(nodes)` marks to bound it. Bound the walk with
/// [`OpenPathsConfig::with_max_depth`], prune with [`Visit::Skip`], or stop
/// early with [`ControlFlow::Break`].
///
/// # Semantics
///
/// - Seeds each start a route of length one, emitted at depth zero in the
///   order supplied. Duplicate seeds start independent routes.
/// - Routes are extended level by level, so events arrive in nondecreasing
///   route length. Successors extend a route in the order the closure pushed
///   them.
/// - [`Visit::Skip`] seals a route without extending it.
/// - `max_depth` bounds extension, not discovery: a route at the bound is
///   still emitted, and never extended.
/// - An extension whose node is already on that route produces
///   [`Refused`](OpenPathsEvent::Refused) instead of a route.
/// - [`ControlFlow::Break`] stops immediately and is returned as
///   `Some(value)`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The property the global-marks walk cannot offer — the first route to reach
/// a goal is a shortest one, even when a longer route was seeded first:
///
/// ```
/// use core::ops::ControlFlow;
